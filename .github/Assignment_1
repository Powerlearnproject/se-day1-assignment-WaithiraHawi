Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

What is Software Engineering and Its Importance

Software engineering is the designing, development, maintenance, testing and evaluation of software. 
A software needs to be efficient, reliable, and maintainable, meeting the need for a stakeholder and the users. 

Key Milestones in Software Engineering

Structured Programming was conceived in the 1960s by Edsgar, bringing about a disciplined approach, improving code maintainability and readability. 
Object-Oriented Programming was sparked in the 1980s, introducing the concept of data encapsulation into objects. It revolutionized how software is designed, leading to reusable, scalable and modular code. 
The 2001 Agile Manifesto formalized the set of principles and values in software development. It emphasized collaboration, flexibility and iterative progress. This has shifted to adaptive methodologies.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle 
Planning: This is defining project goals, scope, and the feasibility.
Requirements Analysis: This entails gathering and analyzing the needs of the user and the system requirements. 
Designing is the creation of architectural and detailed designs for the system.
Implementation is the coding phase, translating design to code. 
Testing is the verification of the software functions, ensuring they correctly meet the requirements. 
Deployment is releasing software to the users.
Maintenance is addressing the issues, or bugs detected after deployment.

Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
Waterfall is the sequential and linear approach where every phase has to be completed before starting a new phase. A waterfall is ideal for building infrastructure systems such as operating systems. 
Agile is the incremental and iterative approach allowing for refinements and changes through the development process. This is the best when a project requires continuous user feedback. For instance, web applications.  

Roles and Responsibilities in a Software Engineering Team

Software Developers are responsible for coding, feature implementation, fix bugs and ensure a software meets design specifications. 
Quality Assurance Engineer tests software, identifying and fixing bugs. The QA ensures software meets quality requirements and standards before it is deployed to the users. 
The project manager checks the project timeline, communication and resources among the stakeholders and team members. The project manager ensures a project meets the set goals. 

Importance of IDEs and VCS in Software Development

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software applications providing comprehensive facilities for a developer to code, debug and test. IDEs include Visual Studio Code. 
Version Control Systems (VCS) allow a developer track and manage the changes to be coded over time. Facilitates collaboration, and code management. It includes Git. 

Common Challenges and Strategies to Overcome
Large systems can be complex, making them hard to manage. Modular design and clear documentation resolves this. 
The requirements might change in the development process. An Agile methodology allows for the effective accommodation of changes. 

Types of Testing and Their Importance
Testing is important in software development as it helps in the identification and early fixing of bugs to ensure the application meets user expectations. 
Unit Testing is used to test the functions of softwares, ensuring it works correctly.
Integration Testing tests how different components of software work together..
Acceptance Testing is used to validate how software is against the specified user requirements. 

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Definition and Importance of Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the effective crafting of prompts for the interaction with the AI models. It entails designing the input text to guide the model, producing desired output. It is important as it impacts the accuracy and relevance of model responses. 
Example 
Vague Prompt: Talk about technology
Ideal Prompt: How has Artificial intelligence impacted healthcare in remote villages? 

The ideal prompt has been improved and is more ideal as it is clear, concise and specific. The prompt is directing AI, focusing on the role of AI in healthcare, and has been localized to a remote village.
